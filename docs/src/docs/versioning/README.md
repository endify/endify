# Versioning
We use semantic versioning for all packages and use common tags for releases.

That means:
- `@latest` is always the latest stable version
- `@next` is always the latest development version
- `vX.X.X-beta.X` means development build of the future version of Endify

We stick to minor `npm` and `node.js` versions with Endify minor versions, same for major.

If you need support for older versions of `npm` and `Node.js` check our troubleshooting guide for most common problems.
