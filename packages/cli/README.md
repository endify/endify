# @endify/cli
This package adds `endify` commands to your project.

This handy tool is actually a wrapper for `@endify/core` which is fully suitable for bundling & starting your next Endify project.

# Install
Navigate to your project folder and run the following in a terminal:
```shell
yarn add @endify/cli  # yarn [RECOMMENDED]
npm i @endify/cli     # npm
pnpm i @endify/cli    # pnpm
```

# Usage

There are 3 simple commands to run, build and start your app:
```bash
endify dev # Start local development server
endify build # Run production optimized build
endify start # Start production build
```
All of the commands listed above are bundled by default but you can add more using **Endify Launchers** and **Endify Hooks**.
