<h1 align="center">Endify</h1>
<p align="center">
Endify is a JavaScript framework aimed at connecting frontend and backend code into one codebase, which opens new possibilities to the world of code.</p>

-------
 ## Motivation
 I was working with Vue Storefront and Nuxt for a while, but their biggest mistake was that it's not everything to make the website work. Of course you need an API in another project, some workers, services and so on... So I realized that why not to connect them both? And here it is - Endify.
